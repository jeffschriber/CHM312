    "In this activity, you will examine some properties of weak interactions between molecules. As the molecular subunits are not connected by any covalent (or ionic) bonds, we often use the term *noncovalent interactions*. Suppose we want to calculate the interaction energy between molecule A and molecule B for a certain geometry of the A-B complex (obviously, this interaction energy depends on how far apart the molecules are and how they are oriented). The simplest way of doing so is by subtraction (in the so-called *supermolecular approach*):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{\\rm int}=E_{\\rm A-B}-E_{\\rm A}-E_{\\rm B}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{\\rm X}$ is the total energy of system X, computed using our favorite electronic structure theory and basis set. A negative value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that A and B have a lower energy when they are together than when they are apart, so they do form a weakly bound complex that might be stable at least at very low temperatures. A positive value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that the A-B complex is unbound - it is energetically favorable for A and B to go their separate ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of two interacting helium atoms and calculate $E_{\\rm int}$ at a few different interatomic distances $R$. You will use Psi4 to calculate the total energies that you need to perform subtraction. When you do so for a couple different $R$, you will be able to sketch the *potential energy curve* - the graph of $E_{\\rm int}(R)$ as a function of $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, but how should you pick the electronic structure method to calculate $E_{\\rm A-B}$, $E_{\\rm A}$, and $E_{\\rm B}$? Let's start with the simplest choice and try out the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. In case HF is not accurate enough, we will also try the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations - CCSD(T). If you haven't heard about CCSD(T) before, let's just state that it is **(1)** usually very accurate (it's even called the *gold standard* of electronic structure theory) and **(2)** very expensive for larger molecules. For the basis set, let's pick the augmented correlation consistent triple-zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis of Dunning which should be quite OK for both HF and CCSD(T).\n"

It gets especially expensive for the calculation of $E_{\\rm A-B}$ because A-B has more electrons than either A or B. Your friend suggests to use CCSD(T) only for the easier terms $E_{\\rm A}$ and $E_{\\rm B}$ and subtract them from $E_{\\rm A-B}$ calculated with a different, cheaper method such as HF. Why is this a really bad idea?\n",

    "A nice feature of the supermolecular approach is that it is very easy to use - you just need to run three standard energy calculations, and modern quantum chemistry codes such as Psi4 give you a lot of methods to choose from. However, the accuracy of subtraction hinges on error cancellation, and we have to be careful to ensure that the errors do cancel between $E_{\\rm A-B}$ and $E_{\\rm A}+E_{\\rm B}$. Another drawback of the supermolecular approach is that it is not particularly rich in physical insight. All that we get is a single number $E_{\\rm int}$ that tells us very little about the underlying physics of the interaction. Therefore, one may want to find an alternative approach where $E_{\\rm int}$ is computed directly, without subtraction, and it is obtained as a sum of distinct, physically meaningful terms. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is such an alternative approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "SAPT is a perturbation theory aimed specifically at calculating the interaction energy between two molecules. Contrary to the supermolecular approach, SAPT obtains the interaction energy directly - no subtraction of similar terms is needed. Moreover, the result is obtained as a sum of separate corrections accounting for the electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange contributions to interaction energy, so the SAPT decomposition facilitates the understanding and physical interpretation of results.\n",
    "- *Electrostatic energy* arises from the Coulomb interaction between charge densities of isolated molecules.\n",

    "- *Dispersion energy* is a consequence of intermolecular electron correlation, usually explained in terms of correlated fluctuations of electron density on both molecules.\n",
    "- *Exchange energy* is a short-range repulsive effect that is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will explore the simplest level of the SAPT theory called SAPT0 (see [Parker:2014] for the definitions of different levels of SAPT). A particular SAPT correction $E^{(nk)}$ corresponds to effects that are of $n$th order in the intermolecular interaction and $k$th order in the intramolecular electron correlation. In SAPT0, intramolecular correlation is neglected, and intermolecular interaction is included through second order:\n",

    "For the next part, you will perform the same analysis and obtain the supermolecular and SAPT0 data for the interaction of two water molecules. We now have many more degrees of freedom: in addition to the intermolecular distance $R$, we can change the relative orientation of two molecules, or even their internal geometries (O-H bond lengths and H-O-H angles). In this way, the potential energy curve becomes a multidimensional *potential energy surface*. It is hard to graph functions of more than two variables, so we will stick to the distance dependence of the interaction energies. Therefore, we will assume one particular orientation of two water molecules (a hydrogen-bonded one) and vary the intermolecular distance $R$ while keeping the orientation, and molecular geometries, constant. The geometry of the A-B complex has been defined for you, but you have to request all the necessary Psi4 calculations and extract the numbers that you need.

    "We clearly have a favorable dipole-dipole interaction, which results in negative (attractive) electrostatic energy. This is how the origins of hydrogen bonding might have been explained to you in your freshman chemistry class: two polar molecules have nonzero dipole moments and the dipole-dipole interaction can be strongly attractive. However, your SAPT components show you that it's not a complete explanation: the two water molecules are bound not only by electrostatics, but by two other SAPT components as well. Can you quantify the relative (percentage) contributions of electrostatics, induction, and dispersion to the overall interaction energy at the van der Waals minimum?

    "Higher levels of SAPT calculations can give very accurate interaction energies, but are more computationally expensive than SAPT0. SAPT0 is normally sufficient for qualitative accuracy and basic understanding of the interaction physics. One important use of SAPT0 is to *classify different intermolecular complexes according to the type of interaction*, and a nice way to display the results of this classification is provided by a *ternary diagram*.\n",

If the electrostatic contribution is repulsive, we can display the relative magnitudes of electrostatic, induction, and dispersion terms in the same way, but we need the second triangle (the left one). The combination of two triangles forms the complete diagram and we can mark lots of different points corresponding to different complexes and geometries.\n",
